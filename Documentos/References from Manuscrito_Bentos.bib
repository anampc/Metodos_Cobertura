              visual estimates and random-point-quadrats (RPQ). Comparisons of
              estimates were made using both quadrats in the rocky intertidal
              zone and simulated quadrats drawn on a computer, where estimates
              could be compared with true, digitized percent cover values. In
              each case, visual estimates were found to be more repeatable
              (less within- and among-observer variation) and more accurate
              (closer to the true value as determined by digitizing) than the
              RPQ method. RPQs using 100 points were more accurate and less
              variable than those using 50 points, but were still less accurate
              (and much slower to carry out) than visual estimates. The RPQ
              method often missed rare species (<2 \% cover) altogether, but
              when it 'hit' them, values were usually overestunated. Visual
              estimates also tended to overestimate percent covers of species
              (although less than the RPQ method), especially uncommon ones.
              Thus although the probabilistic RPQ method is supposedly more
              objective and is statistically valid, visual estimates may give a
              more accurate representation of relahve coverage of sesslle
              organisms, and can reduce overall samphg error because they make
              increased sample sizes possible. Use of small subdvisions in
              quadrats, pre-field observer training, and a conscious effort to
              avoid bias are necessary to make the visual method valid and

  author    = "Wellington, Gerard M",
  abstract  = "The mechanisms that control the distribution and abundance of
               major benthic organ- isms in subtidal coral reef communities are
               poorly understood. Through field experimentation and
               manipulations, this study investigated the factors that account
               for the vertical zonation patterns found on a fringing reef in
               the Gulf of Panama (Pacific). In this community, pocilloporid
               corals form a near-monotypic stand (80-85\% live coral cover) in
               shallow water (0-6 m depth) while massive corals, particularly
               Pavona gigantea, predominate in low density (- 18\% cover) in
               the deeper areas of the reef (6-10 m depth). The paucity of
               massive corals in shallow water results mainly from chronic and
               severe mortality caused by the omnivorous damselfish
               Eupomacentrus acapulcoensis (Pomacentridae). These highly
               territorial fish establish algal mats (used as a source of food
               and nesting site) on hard substrata, including coral. The effect
               of this activity was found to be differential with respect to
               (1) species (i.e., Pavona suffered higher mortality compared to
               Pocillopora) and (2) depth (i.e., the frequency and extent of
               damaged Pavona colonies were higher in shallow compared to deep
               areas). Pavona suffered higher mortality due to differences in
               coral morphology: damselfish are more effective at removing
               tissue from a massive (open) surface than from a tightly
               branched pocilloporid coral. Pavona was most severely damaged in
               shallow water because of depth-related differences in
               topographic com- plexity. By removing the topographic complexity
               surrounding colonies with damselfish and by adding complex
               substratum around colonies without damselfish, it was found that
               damselfish abandon ter- ritories when substratum complexity is
               reduced and immigrate to colonies when complexity is in-
               creased. Immigration eventually led to coral mortality. Hence,
               shelter is a necessary requisite for the establishment of a
               damselfish territory. Censuses revealed that shelter site
               availability surrounding Pavona colonies and damselfish
               abundance (both overall and per individual Pavona colony) were
               greater in shallow compared to deep water. Damselfish were
               conspicuously absent from small colonies (S 1.5 m2 surface area)
               that lacked holes or crevices within the colony or immediately
               adjacent to it; such colonies were only present in deep water.
               Controlled experiments using live coral fragments (simulating
               1-1.5 yr old juveniles) attached to hard substratum demonstrated
               that pocilloporid corals suffer high mortality and substantially
               reduced growth rates in deep reef areas due to grazing by
               pufferfish and parrotfish. The effectiveness of this
               predation/grazing activity was related to the position of the
               coral fragments relative to defended damselfish territories.
               Outside the territory, growth and survivorship of fragments were
               low for Po- cillopora but high for Pavona. Within areas defended
               by damselfish, Pocillopora and Pavona frag- ments grew equally
               well both caged and uncaged. On the algal mat itself, however,
               Pavona fragments suffered high mortality from damselfish;
               Pocillopora growth under these conditions was only tem- porarily
               reduced. The data in this study indicate that damselfish
               territories provide a refuge against juvenile mortality for
               Pocillopora within defended areas, thus facilitating the
               establishment of branch- ing corals in shallow water and
               concomitantly reducing or eliminating its potential space
               competitor, Pavona. A proposed successional model suggests that
               Pocillopora abundance may ultimately control the abundance of
               damselfish. This study indicates that community structure on
               some eastern Pacific reefs may be controlled by the direct and
               indirect behavioral interactions between damselfish and
               transient fish corallivores, and physical factors (availability
               of shelters) limiting the distribution of damselfish.",
